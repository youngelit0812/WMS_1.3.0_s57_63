SUBMARINE CABLES AND PIPELINES

Mariners are advised not to anchor or trawl in the vicinity of submarine
cables and pipelines. Pipelines are not always buried and their presence
may significantly reduce the charted depth. They may also span seabed
undulations and cause fishing gear to become irrecoverably snagged, putting
a vessel in severe danger.
